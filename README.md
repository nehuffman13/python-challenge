 # PyBank 
I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.  


I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  -The total number of months included in the datase
  
  -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  
  -The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  
  -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
  -The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
